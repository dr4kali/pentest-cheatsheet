## Gaining a Shell Through Attacking a Vulnerable Application
#### Search For an Exploit Module

One detail that can be overlooked when relying on MSF to find an exploit module for a specific application is the version of MSF. There may be useful exploit modules that are not installed on our system or just aren't showing up via search. In these cases, it's good to know that Rapid 7 keeps code for exploit modules in their [repos on github](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/tree/master/modules/exploits). We could do an even more specific search using a search engine: `rConfig 3.9.6 exploit metasploit github`

#### Locate

We can copy the code into a file and save it in `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http` similar to where they are storing the code in the GitHub repo. We should also keep msf up to date using the commands `apt update; apt install metasploit-framework` or your local package manager. Once we find the exploit module and download it (we can use wget) or copy it into the proper directory from Github, we can use it to gain a shell session on the target. If we copy it into a file on our local system, make sure the file has `.rb` as the extension. All modules in MSF are written in Ruby.

## Spawning a TTY Shell with Python

#### Interactive Python
```shell-session
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```
