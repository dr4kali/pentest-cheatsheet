#### Starting MSF
```shell-session
sudo msfconsole
```

#### Searching Within Metasploit
```shell-session
search smb
```

|Output|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`56`|The number assigned to the module in the table within the context of the search. This number makes it easier to select. We can use the command `use 56` to select the module.|
|`exploit/`|This defines the type of module. In this case, this is an exploit module. Many exploit modules in MSF include the payload that attempts to establish a shell session.|
|`windows/`|This defines the platform we are targeting. In this case, we know the target is Windows, so the exploit and payload will be for Windows.|
|`smb/`|This defines the service for which the payload in the module is written.|
|`psexec`|This defines the tool that will get uploaded to the target system if it is vulnerable.|
