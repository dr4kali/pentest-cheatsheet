# Certificate Transparency Logs
## CT Logs and Web Recon

Certificate Transparency logs offer a unique advantage in subdomain enumeration compared to other methods. Unlike brute-forcing or wordlist-based approaches, which rely on guessing or predicting subdomain names, CT logs provide a definitive record of certificates issued for a domain and its subdomains. This means you're not limited by the scope of your wordlist or the effectiveness of your brute-forcing algorithm. Instead, you gain access to a historical and comprehensive view of a domain's subdomains, including those that might not be actively used or easily guessable.

Furthermore, CT logs can unveil subdomains associated with old or expired certificates. These subdomains might host outdated software or configurations, making them potentially vulnerable to exploitation.

In essence, CT logs provide a reliable and efficient way to discover subdomains without the need for exhaustive brute-forcing or relying on the completeness of wordlists. They offer a unique window into a domain's history and can reveal subdomains that might otherwise remain hidden, significantly enhancing your reconnaissance capabilities.

Usage
```shell-session
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[]
 | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u
 
```
- `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json"`: This command fetches the JSON output from crt.sh for certificates matching the domain `facebook.com`.
- `jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value'`: This part filters the JSON results, selecting only entries where the `name_value` field (which contains the domain or subdomain) includes the string "`dev.`" The `-r` flag tells `jq` to output raw strings.
- `sort -u`: This sorts the results alphabetically and removes duplicates.
