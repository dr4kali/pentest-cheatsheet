### gobuster

Gobuster is a versatile tool commonly used for directory and file brute-forcing, but it also excels at virtual host discovery. It systematically sends HTTP requests with different `Host` headers to a target IP address and then analyses the responses to identify valid virtual hosts.

There are a couple of things you need to prepare to brute force `Host` headers:

1. `Target Identification`: First, identify the target web server's IP address. This can be done through DNS lookups or other reconnaissance techniques.
2. `Wordlist Preparation`: Prepare a wordlist containing potential virtual host names. You can use a pre-compiled wordlist, such as SecLists, or create a custom one based on your target's industry, naming conventions, or other relevant information.

Usage
```shell-session
gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
```

- The `-u` flag specifies the target URL (replace `<target_IP_address>` with the actual IP).
- The `-w` flag specifies the wordlist file (replace `<wordlist_file>` with the path to your wordlist).
- The `--append-domain` flag appends the base domain to each word in the wordlist.(REQUIRED)
- Consider using the `-t` flag to increase the number of threads for faster scanning.
- The `-k` flag can ignore SSL/TLS certificate errors.
- You can use the `-o` flag to save the output to a file for later analysis.
