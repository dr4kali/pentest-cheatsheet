## The Domain Information Groper

The `dig` command (`Domain Information Groper`) is a versatile and powerful utility for querying DNS servers and retrieving various types of DNS records. Its flexibility and detailed and customizable output make it a go-to choice.

# Subdomain Bruteforcing

Usage
```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -r
```

- `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com`: We specify the target domain we want to enumerate, along with a shortcut for some tuning options ``--enum`.
- `-f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`: We indicate the path to the SecLists wordlist we'll use for brute-forcing. Adjust the path if your SecLists installation is different.
- `-r`: This option enables recursive subdomain brute-forcing, meaning that if `dnsenum` finds a subdomain, it will then try to enumerate subdomains of that subdomain.

## The Zone Transfer Vulnerability

The information gleaned from an unauthorised zone transfer can be invaluable to an attacker. It reveals a comprehensive map of the target's DNS infrastructure, including:

- `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
- `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
- `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

Usage
```shell-session
dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```
