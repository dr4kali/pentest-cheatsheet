### Detecting WAF(`Web Application Firewalls`)

To detect the presence of a WAF, we'll use the `wafw00f` tool.

```shell-session
wafw00f inlanefreight.com
```

### Nikto

`Nikto` is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, `Nikto's` fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

Usage
```shell-session
nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```

The `-h` flag specifies the target host. The `-Tuning b` flag tells `Nikto` to only run the Software Identification modules.
